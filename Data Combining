-- I wanted to combine the data from all the months to a single table:

SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.January`AS January
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.February`AS February
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.March`AS March
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.April`AS April
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.May`AS May
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.June`AS June
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.July`AS July
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.August`AS August
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.September`AS September
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.October`AS October
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.November`AS November
UNION ALL
SELECT *
FROM `my-project-gda-410913.Months.December`AS December

â€“ Then saved the query result as a new table named "All"
