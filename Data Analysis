– I wanted to see how was the variability of both member and casual riders throughout the year: 

SELECT
Month,
member_casual,
SUM (Hours) AS duration,
COUNT(ride_id) AS Total_rides,
AVG (duration) AS Average_duration
FROM Months.ALL
GROUP BY member_casual, Month


–Checking to see at which days of the week casual riders use more frequently and where are the differences to what members do:


SELECT
AVG(duration) AS Average_Duration
COUNT(ride_id),
Weekday,
member_casual
FROM Months.ALL_MONTHS
GROUP BY Weekday, member_casual
ORDER BY Weekday


– I wanted to see the main locations from where the casual riders start and end their trips more frequently to see if there is a pattern:


SELECT
COUNT(ride_id) AS Total_Rides,
start_station_name
FROM Months.ALL_MONTHS
WHERE start_station_name IS NOT NULL AND member_casual = "casual"
GROUP BY start_station_name
ORDER BY Total_Rides DESC;


SELECT
COUNT(ride_id) AS Total_Rides,
end_station_name
FROM Months.ALL_MONTHS
WHERE end_station_name IS NOT NULL AND member_casual = "casual"
GROUP BY end_station_name
ORDER BY Total_Rides DESC


– Wanted to see how member and casual use different tipes of bikes 


SELECT
rideable_type,
member_casual,
COUNT(ride_id) AS total_rides
FROM
Months.All_data_combined
GROUP BY
rideable_type, member_casual
