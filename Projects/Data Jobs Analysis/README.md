# Data Jobs Analysis

## Introduction and Context
In this project I will present the analysis I've made to compare a few jobs in the data area. As an Agricultural Engineer who recently started to enter the field of Data Analytics, there were some questions that I would like to answer for my own knowledge, hence this project! As a person quite unaware of the details and conditions of Data Jobs and, since I took the time cultivate myself a bit in that area, I would now like to know a bit more about it!

Since there are a lot of options in this area, especially if you consider that you can learn online most of the skills that are necessary to thrive in it, I've decided to do it also with the possibility of help me navigate in it with a bit more certainty, particularly learning about what people already working in the area consider to be the most important tools you must have to succeed in it.

With that being said, that is one of the criteria I chose to analyze in this project. Others, like salary, job availability and level of satisfaction of people working in the Data Analytics field in different parameters were also evaluated throughout this project! Remember that this is project of my own initiative and so all this criteria was based in my own criteria and in the topics that I wanted to run through. So, if you're also keen on learning more about this area, stick around! I will gladly share with you what I have found.
